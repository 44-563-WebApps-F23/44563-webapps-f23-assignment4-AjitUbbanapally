       <p>INTRODUCTION.</p> 


With _The Master Builder_--or _Master Builder Solness_, as the title
runs in the original--we enter upon the final stage in Ibsen's career.
"You are essentially right," the poet wrote to Count Prozor in March
1900, "when you say that the series which closes with the Epilogue
(_When We Dead Awaken_) began with _Master Builder Solness_."

"Ibsen," says Dr. Brahm, "wrote in Christiania all the four works which
he thus seems to bracket together--_Solness_, _Eyolf_, _Borkman_, and
_When We Dead Awaken_. He returned to Norway in July 1891, for a stay of
indefinite length; but the restless wanderer over Europe was destined
to leave his home no more.... He had not returned, however, to throw
himself, as of old, into the battle of the passing day. Polemics are
entirely absent from the poetry of his old age. He leaves the State and
Society at peace. He who had departed as the creator of Falk [in _Love's
Comedy_] now, on his return, gazes into the secret places of human
nature and the wonder of his own soul."

Dr. Brahm, however, seems to be mistaken in thinking that Ibsen returned
to Norway with no definite intention of settling down. Dr. Julius Elias
(an excellent authority) reports that shortly before Ibsen left Munich
in 1891, he remarked one day, "I must get back to the North!" "Is that
a sudden impulse?" asked Elias. "Oh no," was the reply; "I want to be
a good head of a household and have my affairs in order. To that end I
must consolidate may property, lay it down in good securities, and
get it under control--and that one can best do where one has rights of
citizenship." Some critics will no doubt be shocked to find the poet
whom they have written down an "anarchist" confessing such bourgeois
motives.

After his return to Norway, Ibsen's correspondence became very scant,
and we have no letters dating from the period when he was at work on
_The Master Builder_. On the other hand, we possess a curious lyrical
prelude to the play, which he put on paper on March 16, 1892. It is
said to have been his habit, before setting to work on a play, to
"crystallise in a poem the mood which then possessed him;" but the
following is the only one of these keynote poems which has been
published. I give it in the original language, with a literal
translation:


DE SAD DER, DE TO--

     De sad der, de to, i saa lunt et hus
     ved host og i venterdage,
     Saa braendte huset.  Alt ligger i grus.
     De to faar i asken rage.

     For nede id en er et smykke gemt,--
     et smykke, som aldrig kan braende.
     Og leder de trofast, haender det nemt
     at det findes af ham eller hende.

     Men finder de end, brandlidte to,
     det dyre, ildfaste smykke,--
     aldrig han finder sin braendte tro,
     han aldrig sin braendte lykke.


THEY SAT THERE, THE TWO--

  They sat there, the two, in so cosy a house, through autumn
  and winter days.  Then the house burned down.  Everything
  lies in ruins.  The two must grope among the ashes.

  For among them is hidden a jewel--a jewel that never can burn.
  And if they search faithfully, it may easily happen that he
  or she may find it.

  But even should they find it, the burnt-out two--find this
  precious unburnable jewel--never will she find her burnt faith,
  he never his burnt happiness.


This is the latest piece of Ibsen's verse that has been given to the
world; but one of his earliest poems--first printed in 1858--was also,
in some sort, a prelude to _The Master Builder_

<p>CHARACTERS.</p>


  <p>HALVARD SOLNESS, Master Builder.
    ALINE SOLNESS, his wife.
    DOCTOR HERDAL, physician.
    KNUT BROVIK, formerly an architect, now in SOLNESS'S employment.
    RAGNAR BROVIK, his son, draughtsman.
    KAIA BROVIK, his niece, book-keeper.
    MISS HILDA WANGEL.
    Some Ladies.
    A Crowd in the street.</p>

<p>
    <p>ACT THIRD.</p>
<p>
    The large broad verandah of SOLNESS'S dwelling-house.  Part
    of the house, with outer door leading to the verandah, is
    seen to the left.  A railing along the verandah to the right.
    At the back, from the end of the verandah, a flight of steps
    leads down to the garden below.  Tall old trees in the
    garden spread their branches over the verandah and towards
    the house.  Far to the right, in among the trees, a glimpse
    is caught of the lower part of the new villa, with scaffolding
    round so much as is seen of the tower.  In the background
    the garden is bounded by an old wooden fence.  Outside the
    fence, a street with low, tumble-down cottages.
  
    Evening sky with sun-lit clouds.
  
    On the verandah, a garden bench stands along the wall of the
    house, and in front of the bench a long table.  On the other
    side of the table, an arm-chair and some stools.  All the
    furniture is of wicker-work.
  
    MRS. SOLNESS, wrapped in a large white crepe shawl, sits
    resting in the arm-chair and gazes over to the right.
    Shortly after, HILDA WANGEL comes up the flight of steps
    from the garden.  She is dressed as in the last act, and
    wears her hat.  She has in her bodice a little nosegay of
    small common flowers.
  </p>
  
  <b>MRS. SOLNESS.</b>
  <br>[Turning her head a little.]
   Have you been round the garden, Miss
    Wangel?
  
  <p></p>
  
  <b>HILDA.</b>
  
  <br>Yes, I have been taking a look at it.</br>
  
  <p></p>
  <b>MRS. SOLNESS.</b>
  
  <br>And found some flowers too, I see.</br>
  <p></p>
  <b>HILDA.</b>
  
  <br>Yes, indeed! There are such heaps of them in among the bushes.</br>
  
  <p></p>
  <b>MRS. SOLNESS.</b>
  
  <br>Are there, really? Still? You see I scarcely ever go there.<br>
  <p></p>
  
  <b>HILDA.</b>
 <br>[Closer.] What! Don't you take a run down into the garden every day,
    then? 
  
  <p> </p>
  <b>MRS. SOLNESS.</b>
  
  <br>[With a faint smile.] 
  I don't "run" anywhere, nowadays. 
<p></p>
  <b>HILDA.</b>

<br>Well, but do you not go down now and then to look at all the lovely
  things there?</br>

<p></p>
<b>MRS. SOLNESS.</b>

<br>It has all become so strange to me. I am almost afraid to see it again.</br>

<p></p>
<b>HILDA.</b>

<br>Your own garden!</br>
